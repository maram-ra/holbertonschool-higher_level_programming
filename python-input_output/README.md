## Description
This project covers how to read from and write to files using Python. It also introduces JSON serialization and deserialization, and how to manage file resources safely with context managers.

## Key Concepts
- Reading and writing text files
- File modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `r+`)
- Using `with` statement for file handling
- Working with JSON using `json` module
- Serializing and deserializing Python objects
- Using command-line arguments with `sys.argv`
- Implementing classes that support JSON serialization
- Generating Pascalâ€™s Triangle

## Files
Each Python script implements a specific task related to file input/output and JSON handling. Scripts follow the format `X-task_name.py`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Followed PEP8 standards (pycodestyle)
- All files are executable

## Usage
Each script can be run individually. Example:
```bash
./0-main.py

# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

Part of Holberton Foundations v2.1 - Part 2

---

## Description

This project explores two powerful data structures in Python: sets and dictionaries.  
It also introduces functional programming tools like `lambda`, `map`, and `filter` to make the code more efficient and expressive.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I can:

### Sets
- Understand what sets are and how to use them
- Use common set methods (union, intersection, difference, etc.)
- Know when to use sets vs. lists
- Iterate through a set

### Dictionaries
- Store and manage data using key-value pairs
- Access, update, and delete dictionary items
- Iterate over keys and values
- Decide when to use dictionaries vs. sets or lists

### Functional Tools
- Use `lambda` functions for short, anonymous logic
- Use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to process data efficiently

## General Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Code follows `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All scripts start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All files are executable
- No external imports allowed

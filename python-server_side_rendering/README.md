# Python - Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

This project is about building dynamic web pages using Python and Flask. Instead of using JavaScript in the browser, pages are created on the server using Jinja templates.

## Goals

- Understand server-side vs client-side rendering.
- Build dynamic HTML using Flask and Jinja2.
- Read data from JSON, CSV, and SQLite.
- Handle missing data and invalid inputs.
- Use reusable templates (header, footer, etc).


## How to Run

1. Install Flask:

```bash
pip install Flask

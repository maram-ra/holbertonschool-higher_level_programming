# Python - Classes and Objects

This project introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.

You'll learn how to structure code using classes, how to define and protect attributes, and how to design methods that interact with data cleanly and clearly.

## What youâ€™ll learn

- What OOP is and why it matters
- What a class is
- What an object or instance is
- The difference between a class and an instance
- How to define attributes
- How to use public, protected, and private attributes
- What `self` means and how it works
- What a method is
- How `__init__` sets up a new object
- Abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding
- What a property is
- The difference between an attribute and a property
- The Pythonic way to use getters and setters
- How to dynamically add attributes to an instance
- How Python stores attributes in `__dict__`
- How to use `getattr` to access values safely

## Rules

- Use Python 3.8.5
- Every `.py` file starts with: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- End every file with a new line
- No unnecessary imports
- Follow [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) 2.7.*
- All code must be executable
- Every module, class, and function must have a proper docstring

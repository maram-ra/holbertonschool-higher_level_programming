# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project dives into the core logic tools in Python—`if`, `else`, loops, and functions. It’s about learning to write clean, readable, and functional Python scripts by using control flow, working with numbers, and understanding function structure.

### What I learned

- How Python handles indentation (and why it's a big deal)
- Writing conditional logic using `if`, `else`, and `elif`
- Using `while` and `for` loops efficiently
- Controlling loops using `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
- Printing formatted strings using f-strings and `.format()`
- Writing reusable functions and understanding variable scope
- Handling tracebacks and learning from error messages
- Arithmetic operations and how to use them in real scripts

### Tasks Breakdown

- **0-positive_or_negative.py** – Check if a number is positive, zero, or negative.
- **1-last_digit.py** – Extract and evaluate the last digit of a number.
- **2-print_alphabet.py** – Print the lowercase alphabet in a single line.
- **3-print_alphabt.py** – Same as above, but skip 'q' and 'e'.
- **4-print_hexa.py** – Print numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hex.
- **5-print_comb2.py** – Print all numbers from 0 to 99 with leading zero formatting.
- **6-print_comb3.py** – Show all unique two-digit combinations without repeats.
- **7-islower.py** – Custom function to check if a character is lowercase.
- **8-uppercase.py** – Convert and print a string in uppercase without using `.upper()`.
- **9-print_last_digit.py** – Function that returns the last digit of a number.
- **10-add.py** – Add two integers.
- **11-pow.py** – Custom power function.
- **12-fizzbuzz.py** – Classic FizzBuzz from 1 to 100.

### Usage

All scripts are executable with `python3` and follow PEP8 guidelines. No external libraries. No shortcuts. Just solid fundamentals.

### How to run

```bash
chmod +x *.py
./<filename>.py
